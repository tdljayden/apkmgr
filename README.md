# apkmgr
apkmgr (abbreviation of APK Manager) plans to be a fully featured cli package manager for Android apps, based on the F-Droid repositories.

Current requirements are:
*fdroidcl (for downloading and querying APKs from the f-droid repositories)
*termux (for running the program)
*any android app that allows you to open APKs and install them

To do:
*Add a function for searching
*Implement an install using xdg-open for the downloaded apk during sync
